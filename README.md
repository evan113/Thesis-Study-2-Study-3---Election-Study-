# Thesis-Study-2-Study-3---Election-Study-

I intend on investigating the underlying mechanisms that enable individuals to transition from wanting to justify, rationalize, and legitimize certain
social and political systems to challenging and even rebelling against those very systems. Through the supervision of my three Ph.D. supervisors
(James H. Liu, Matt Williams, And Stuart Carr) and an outside university collaborator (Professor Rosalind Searle), we intend to run a multi-wave
data collection design (3-time points) in which a country's general election is used as a political event (natural experiment) that may elicit
psychological and emotional responses for individuals that may contribute to how these individuals perceive the legitimacy of their country's
political and social systems. This is especially relevant for those who are on the losing (political) side of an election, as a means to investigate how
those who lose power politically combat such social upheaval. Through this approach, I intend to explore whether individuals on the
winning/losing side of an election contribute to system justification or system rebellion and therefore find methods of normative and nonnormative
(conspiracy theorizing) collective action to make sense of their social reality.
